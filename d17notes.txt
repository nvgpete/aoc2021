Launching a probe into a trench

There is no d17a.c since I did the first part by hand. Note that for a probe
launched upward, its y velocity when it comes back to y=0 will be the same
as its initial upward velocity. The largest this can be will exactly reach
the deepest value of the target area, which is -215, in one second. The height
reached will be 1/2*vy*(vy-1)=23005.

For part b, note that the velocities are independent, so for each time t
that we might be in the target area we can find how many values of vx and vy
will be in the specified range and multiply them together, and then add them
all up for the values of t, up to the maximum value of t which can be
derived from what we found in part a. The only fly in the ointment is that
there may be some values of vx and vy that produce points in the target area
for two consecutive times so we subtract those off.
