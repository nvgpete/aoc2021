Polymer expansion

Many times there is an easy way to solve part a which does not extend to
part b because of memory or time constraints. This is an example.

In part a, I kept a string containing the polymer, which expanded to about
20,000 bytes after 10 iterations, easily fitting in memory.

In part b, 40 iterations creates a string far too large for memory so I
need to do something else. By creating counts of pairwise adjacent elements
I can store only those counts, and add elements based on the adjacent pairs.

Obviously, I could throw away part a since part b's methodology would work
just as well for 10 iterations. I won't because it's a good illustration of
how ones first idea is not always best.

Also note that method b runs faster on 40 iterations than method a on 10.
