Image enhancement

Two tricky parts
1. The active part of the image grows by 1 in each of the 4 directions with
each iteration.
2. Because the background flips between empty and '#' with each iteration,
we need a 1 pixel wide guard band at each edge of the area which is filled
with either empty or '#'.

I could have been more efficient by only looking at the active part of the
image and enlarging by 1 each iteration, but that way lays madness, since
it runs in 1/20 second in its inefficient form.
