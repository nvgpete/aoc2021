Sea cucumbers on a torus

(I think putting them on a torus is more realistic than currents pushing
them back to the start of the grid.)

Only 1 part, and easy since no one has time for hard programs on Christmas
Eve and early Christmas morning.

The only trick I used was to copy the first column to 1 past the last before
the horizontal step and then copying it back to column 1, and similarly for
the rows and the vertical step.
