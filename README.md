These are solutions written in c for the Advent of Code - 2021. Each problem
generally has two parts. Examples of filenames for day 7 are:
d7a.c - solution for first part
d7b.c - solution for second part
d7x.txt - example data set
d7a.txt - problem data set, usually (always?) the same for both parts.

Files of the sort d7b.c may not exist if the two parts of the problem were
similar enough to do both in d7a.c.

The c programs generally have an fopen statement where I can change the data
file and recompile to go between datasets.

Sometimes, as in day 8, there may be a third program = d8c.c. This is an
indication I thought of a better way to do the second part of the problem.

These are not examples of good coding style nor necessarily of good code
as they are one-offs where getting them to work quickly and correctly was the
main objective.
