Decoding elves BITS transmissions

Recursive descent on the packets seems indicated.

The c %8x format string gets 32 bits at a time without worrying about
unpacking hex values. Only need to pad input out with 0's to a multiple of 8
bytes.

In the example data, d16x.txt, I have collected all the examples given into
one file, thus the loop over lines which is unnecessary for the problem
data.
