Adding snailfish numbers

I decided to store the snailfish numbers as c strings rather than try
something more natural like an object or tree which I didn't feel like
implementing in c.

Since the only legal characters in reduced snailfish numbers are '[],' and
the digits 0-9 there is not much to parse. During reduction, integers may be
larger than 9, but I still wanted to store them in a character. I used ASCII
characters larger than '9' (eg ':'=10,';'=11 etc) to hold the larger
integers. Unfortunately, it was possible for these integers to become as
large as 43='[' and 45=']' messing up the structure of the snailfish number.

The next option was to use characters over 128 to represent the larger
numbers; 138=10,139=11 etc. This required me to change the char variables to
unsigned char. (If you compile with -Wall, you might notice this leads to
pages of warnings, all harmless in this case. In a real program I might
figure out what exactly needs to be unsigned, throw in a bunch of casts and
eliminate the warnings, but I'd spent enough time debugging this already.) I
also made an add() subroutine since adding this mishmash of number
representations required enough statements to not want to inline it.

The magnitude calculation also caused some grief as I thought I could do it
in place, but a rare errant overwrite of part of the string forced me to use a
second string to write the result.

I am happy to not be a snailfish.
