Mucking with binary numbers to find power and life support values

The number of bits in the input is hard-coded. Change the #DEFINE statement
to 5 for the example data, 12 for the real data.

Part a store does not store the bits since they can be counted as they are
read. Part b stores them as 12 bit integers and uses bit manipulations to
solve the problem.
