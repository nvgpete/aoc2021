Reactor reboot - overlapping 3D blocks

With a MB of ram and 3 loops over xyz, part a is easy.

To get part b, compile with -D PARTB.

In part b I keep a list of blocks. Each time a new block intersects a
previous block, the previous block is split in the x, y and z directions to
make 0-6 blocks which don't intersect the new block, and are added to the 
list. If the new block is 'off' it's then thrown away; otherwise it's added
to the list.
