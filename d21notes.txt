Dirac dice game

There are no data files for this problem; the starting positions for the
example data and the problem data are on two consecutive lines of each
program with one of them commented out.

Part a is easy, though I did renumber the positions to 0..9 and made an
array of what the 3 dice would add up to mod 10 on consecutive turns to
simplify.

Part b generates far too many universes to track them all separately. I
created a 4D array indexed by each player's position and points which keeps
track of the number of ways that position can be reached. If a player goes
past 21 the count is added to that player's win count; otherwise the
count is added to the new position reached.
